# Se-L
Se-L (pronounced cell) is short for seamless e-Learning. Se-L is not (just) an e-learning platform. It is a platform for schools to transform/transfer their physical facilities/system to an online/virtual platform. Regular e-learning platform provides students with a self-directed learning system but Se-L offers your school a platform on which they can offer you the same exact learning services they have been providing (with very little modification in methodology) prior to the COVID19 pandemic, except that this time, there is not physical meeting. Ceteris Paribus, each student under the Se-L platform will still be taught by their usual lecturers and teachers, retain the same class and classmates and most importantly, progress with their normal school curriculum seamlessly, regardless of the current pandemic. Schools will retain autonomy and control of their schools within the Se-L platform. The hierarchy of authority and organisation of the school will be entirely retained with offices and positions maintained as they were in the physical setting. In summary, logging unto the Se-L platform is equivalent to walking into your school premises; you can walk to class, walk to the teacher’s/lecturer’s office, walk to the department’s office or even go to the library. The only difference is that with Se-L, you don’t have to walk, all you need is your cell and mobile network.
